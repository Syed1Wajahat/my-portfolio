        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
           My name is syed wajahat.I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. 
           There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, 
           I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. 
           I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; 
           I like to feel the music flowing on my face,
            I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean.
             I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind,
              I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.
               I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. 
               I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, 
               I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace,
                I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, 
                I like the flat cornfield in Champaign.
                 I like delicious food and comfortable shoes;
                  I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, 
            I like people. And, I like to laugh.
